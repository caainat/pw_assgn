Q1. What is a time series, and what are some common applications of time series analysis?
A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at regular time intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly).

Applications:

Forecasting: stock prices, sales, weather

Anomaly Detection: fraud detection, quality control

Trend Analysis: economic indicators, social media trends

Demand Planning: supply chain, energy usage

Q2. What are some common time series patterns, and how can they be identified and interpreted?
Trend: Long-term increase/decrease (e.g., rising sales)

Seasonality: Repeating patterns at regular intervals (e.g., higher sales in December)

Cyclic Patterns: Irregular fluctuations over longer periods (e.g., economic cycles)

Noise: Random, irregular fluctuations

Identification:

Visual inspection (line plots)

Decomposition methods

ACF plots for seasonality

Q3. How can time series data be preprocessed before applying analysis techniques?
Handling Missing Values: Interpolation, forward/backward fill

Smoothing: Moving averages, exponential smoothing

Detrending: Differencing or regression

Deseasonalizing: Seasonal decomposition

Transformation: Log or Box-Cox to stabilize variance

Stationarity Check: ADF/KPSS test

Q4. How can time series forecasting be used in business decision-making, and what are some common challenges and limitations?
Uses:

Inventory management

Marketing campaign planning

Budgeting and revenue forecasting

Challenges:

Data quality and missing values

Sudden structural breaks (e.g., COVID-19)

Model overfitting or underfitting

Assumption violations (e.g., non-stationarity)

Q5. What is ARIMA modelling, and how can it be used to forecast time series data?
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) combines:

AR (p): Past values

I (d): Differencing for stationarity

MA (q): Past forecast errors

Used for: Forecasting univariate time series after making it stationary

Q6. How do Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots help in identifying the order of ARIMA models?
ACF Plot:

Identifies MA (q) order

Sharp cut-off at lag q

PACF Plot:

Identifies AR (p) order

Sharp cut-off at lag p

Gradual decay suggests higher values for p or q

Q7. What are the assumptions of ARIMA models, and how can they be tested for in practice?
Assumptions:

Stationarity of the series

Linearity

Residuals are white noise (no autocorrelation, constant variance, normality)

Tests:

ADF test for stationarity

Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation

Q-Q plot for residual normality

ACF plot of residuals

Q8. Suppose you have monthly sales data for a retail store for the past three years. Which type of time series model would you recommend for forecasting future sales, and why?
Recommended Model: SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

Why:

Captures both trend and seasonality (monthly patterns)

Useful for monthly retail sales data which often show seasonal spikes

Q9. What are some of the limitations of time series analysis? Provide an example of a scenario where the limitations of time series analysis may be particularly relevant.
Limitations:

Assumes past patterns will continue

Sensitive to outliers or sudden changes

Needs a lot of historical data

Example:

During a pandemic or economic crash, previous patterns become irrelevantâ€”forecasts fail.

Q10. Explain the difference between a stationary and non-stationary time series. How does the stationarity of a time series affect the choice of forecasting model?
Stationary Series: Constant mean and variance over time, no trend/seasonality

Non-Stationary Series: Has trend or changing variance

Effect:

Many models (like ARIMA) require the data to be stationary

Differencing or transformation is needed for non-stationary series
