Q1. 
What is Min-Max Scaling, and how is it used in data preprocessing?
Min-Max Scaling is a normalization technique that scales the features of a dataset to a fixed range, typically [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This ensures that all features have the same scale, which is useful 
when working with algorithms like KNN or gradient-based methods that are sensitive to the magnitude of features.


 
Q2. 
What is the Unit Vector Technique in feature scaling, and how does it differ from Min-Max Scaling?
The Unit Vector Scaling technique normalizes a feature by scaling each feature vector to have a unit norm, i.e., the Euclidean distance of the vector becomes 1. This scaling is typically used when
direction is more important than magnitude.
 
Difference:

Min-Max scaling transforms data into a fixed range, preserving the relative distances between data points.
Unit vector scaling ensures the data points are normalized to have unit norm.

Q3. 
What is PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and how is it used in dimensionality reduction?
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining most of its variance. It does this by transforming the original features into new features 
(principal components) that are linear combinations of the original ones. The components are ordered by the amount of variance they capture, and you can choose a subset of these components to reduce
the dimensionality.

Example: In a dataset with 10 features, PCA might reduce it to 3 principal components that capture 95% of the variance.

Q4.
What is the relationship between PCA and Feature Extraction, and how can PCA be used for Feature Extraction?
PCA is closely related to feature extraction because it transforms the original features into new, uncorrelated features (principal components) that represent the data in a more compact way. These
principal components are essentially extracted features that capture the most important information in the data.

Example: In an image dataset, the first few principal components might capture the overall shape or color gradients of the image, which are the most important features for classification.

Q5
. Using Min-Max Scaling to Preprocess a Food Delivery Service Dataset
For a food delivery service recommendation system with features like price, rating, and delivery time, Min-Max Scaling can be applied to standardize these features. This is essential because the
price might range from $5 to $100, while delivery time might range from 5 to 60 minutes. Without scaling, features with large ranges can dominate the model.

Steps:
Identify min and max for each feature.
Apply the Min-Max Scaling formula to transform all features to a range of [0, 1].
Use the scaled values to train the recommendation model.

Q6.
Using PCA to Reduce Dimensionality in a Stock Price Prediction Project
For a stock price prediction project, the dataset might have many features such as company financial metrics and market trends. High-dimensional data can cause overfitting and long training times.
PCA helps by reducing the number of features while keeping most of the variance.

Steps:
Standardize the features (important for PCA).
Apply PCA to identify principal components that explain the majority of the variance.
Select the top components that capture the most variance (e.g., 95%) and use them for model training.
Q7. Min-Max Scaling Example: Dataset [1, 5, 10, 15, 20]
To scale the values to the range [-1, 1]:

Steps:
Identify min = 1 and max = 20.
Apply the Min-Max Scaling formula:
𝑋𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒 =𝑋−120−1×(1−(−1))+(−1)
X scaled= 20−1X−1 ×(1−(−1))+(−1)
Scaling each value:
For 1: −11
For 5: −0.6842−0.6842
For 10: −0.2632−0.2632
For 15: 0.1579
For 20: 11
Q8. PCA for Feature Extraction in Dataset [height, weight, age, gender, blood pressure]
For a dataset with features like height, weight, age, gender, and blood pressure, PCA can be used to extract the most significant features.

Steps:

Standardize the data.
Apply PCA and calculate the explained variance for each principal component.
Retain the components that capture a high percentage of the variance (e.g., 90%).
Principal Components: You may retain 2-3 components depending on the explained variance. For example, height and weight might be correlated, and PCA could combine them into one principal component.
