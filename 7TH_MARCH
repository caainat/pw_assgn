Q1. The three measures of central tendency are:
   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode

Q2. 
   - Mean: It is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the total number of values.
   It represents the average value of the dataset.
   - Median: It is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. 
   If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.
   - Mode: It is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

   These measures are used to describe the center or typical value of a dataset. Mean provides the
   average value, median provides the middle value, and mode provides the most frequently occurring value.

Q3. Measures of central tendency for the given height data:
   - Mean ≈ 177.66
   - Median ≈ 177
   - Mode ≈ 178

Q4. Standard deviation for the given data: ≈ 2.17

Q5. Measures of dispersion like range, variance, and standard deviation are used to quantify the extent to 
which the values in a dataset differ from the central tendency measures like mean or median. For example,
a larger standard deviation indicates that the values are more spread out from the mean, while a smaller
standard deviation indicates that the values are closer to the mean.

Q6. A Venn diagram is a visual representation of the relationships between different sets. It consists of
overlapping circles or other shapes, each representing a set. The overlapping regions represent intersections between the sets.

Q7. For the sets A = {2,3,4,5,6,7} & B = {0,2,6,8,10}:
   (i) A ∩ B = {2,6}
   (ii) A ⋃ B = {0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}

Q8. Skewness in data refers to the lack of symmetry. If the data is right-skewed, it means that the right tail
of the distribution is longer or stretched out relative to the left tail.

Q9. If a data is right-skewed, the median will be positioned to the left of the mean.

Q10. Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together. Correlation, on the other hand,
standardizes covariance by dividing it by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables,
resulting in a value between -1 and 1. Covariance is used to measure the direction of linear relationship between 
variables, while correlation measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship.

Q11. Formula for calculating the sample mean:
   Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)
   Example: For a dataset {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}, the mean = (3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11) / 5 = 7.

Q12. For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.

Q13. Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together, while correlation measures the strength and
direction of the linear relationship between two variables, standardized to a range of -1 to 1.

Q14. Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion. For example, if there is an outlier
with an extremely high value in a dataset, it can pull the mean towards it, making it larger than what it would be without
the outlier. Similarly, outliers can increase the variance and standard deviation, indicating greater spread in the data.
