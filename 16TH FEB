 Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.

Database:
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system.

SQL vs. NoSQL Databases:

| Feature       | SQL Databases                              | NoSQL Databases                               |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Data Model    | Relational (tables with rows and columns)  | Non-relational (document, key-value, graph, or wide-column) |
| Schema        | Fixed schema                               | Dynamic schema                                |
| Query Language| Structured Query Language (SQL)            | Various, depending on the type (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-like query language) |
| ACID Compliance| Yes (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | Varies, but often BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) |
| Scaling       | Vertical scaling (adding more power to the same machine) | Horizontal scaling (adding more machines to the pool) |
| Examples      | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server   | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j              |

Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.
ANS
DDL (Data Definition Language):
DDL is a subset of SQL used to define and modify database structures, such as tables, indexes, and schemas.
Commands:
- CREATE: Used to create a new database object, like a table or a database.
    CREATE TABLE Students (
        StudentID int,
        Name varchar(255),
        Age int
    );
  

- DROP:Used to delete an existing database object.
    DROP TABLE Students;

- ALTER: Used to modify an existing database object.
    ALTER TABLE Students ADD COLUMN Grade char(1);

- TRUNCATE: Used to remove all records from a table, but the table structure remains.
    TRUNCATE TABLE Students;



Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example

DML (Data Manipulation Language):
DML is used for managing data within schema objects. These are the operations you use to manipulate the data stored in the database.
Commands:
- INSERT: Used to insert data into a table.
    INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 20);

- UPDATE: Used to modify existing data in a table.
    UPDATE Students SET Age = 21 WHERE StudentID = 1;

- DELETE: Used to delete existing data from a table.
    DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 1;



 Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.
DQL (Data Query Language):
DQL is used to query the database and retrieve data.
Command:
- SELECT: Used to retrieve data from a database.
    SELECT Name, Age FROM Students WHERE Age > 18;

 
 Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.
- Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values.
    CREATE TABLE Students (
        StudentID int PRIMARY KEY,
        Name varchar(255),
        Age int
    );
  

- Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns that provides a link between data in two tables. It acts as a cross-reference between tables by referencing the primary key of another table
    CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
        EnrollmentID int PRIMARY KEY,
        StudentID int,
        CourseID int,
        FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID)
    );
  

Q6. Write a Python code to connect MySQL to Python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.
import mysql.connector
# Establish the connection
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="yourusername",
    password="yourpassword",
    database="yourdatabase"
)

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute an SQL query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Students")

# Fetch and print the results
results = cursor.fetchall()
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()

#- cursor(): This method creates a cursor object, which is used to execute SQL commands and fetch data from the database.
#- execute(): This method executes the given SQL command.

Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.
The order of execution of SQL clauses is:
1. FROM: Determines the source of the data.
2. WHERE: Filters the rows.
3. GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregate data.
4. HAVING: Filters groups based on a condition.
5. SELECT: Selects the columns to be displayed.
6. ORDER BY: Sorts the result set.
7. LIMIT: Limits the number of rows returned.

Example:
SELECT Name, COUNT(*)
FROM Students
WHERE Age > 18
GROUP BY Name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY Name
LIMIT 10;
