ANS1
Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. 
It provides methods for making inferences and decisions in the presence of uncertainty based on data.

ANS 2 
- Descriptive Statistics: These statistics summarize and describe features of a dataset. For example, calculating the mean, median, and mode of exam scores in a class.
- Inferential Statistics: These statistics involve making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample from that population. For instance, using
hypothesis testing to determine if a new teaching method improves exam scores.

ANS 3 
- Qualitative Data: This type of data describes qualities or characteristics and can be categorical. For example, the color of mangoes (yellow, green, orange, red).
- Quantitative Data: This type of data consists of numerical measurements or counts. It can be further categorized into discrete or continuous data. For instance,
the height data of a class (continuous) or the number of mangoes exported by a farm (discrete).

ANS 4 

(i) Grading in exam: This dataset represents qualitative data as it consists of categories or labels (A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E).

(ii) Colour of mangoes: This dataset also represents qualitative data as it consists of categories or labels (yellow, green, orange, red).

(iii) Height data of a class: This dataset represents quantitative data as it consists of numerical measurements (178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8, ...).

(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: This dataset also represents quantitative data as it consists of numerical measurements (500, 600, 478, 672, ...).

ANS 5
- Nominal: This level of measurement involves categorical data without any inherent order or ranking. An example could be the colors of cars: red, blue, green.
- Ordinal: This level involves categorical data with a clear ordering or ranking. For example, educational levels: high school, bachelor's, master's, Ph.D.
- Interval: This level includes numerical data where the difference between any two values is meaningful but there is no true zero point. An example could be
temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
- Ratio: This level includes numerical data where there is a true zero point, and ratios are meaningful. For example, height, weight, and counts of objects.

. ANS 6
Understanding the level of measurement is crucial because it determines the types of statistical analyses and operations that can be performed on the data.
For instance, it guides whether arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction are meaningful. For example, while you can add and subtract temperatures
measured in Celsius, you cannot do so with nominal data like car colors.

ANS 7
Nominal data represent categories without any inherent order, while ordinal data have a clear order or ranking. For instance, in nominal data like car colors,
there's no inherent order, whereas in ordinal data like educational levels, there is a clear ranking from lower to higher levels of education.

ANS 8 
A box plot or box-and-whisker plot is commonly used to display data in terms of range. It shows the minimum, maximum, median, and quartiles of a dataset,
providing a visual representation of the spread of the data.

ANS 9
Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe features of a dataset, such as mean, median, and standard deviation. Inferential statistics,
on the other hand, involve making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample from that population. For example, calculating the average
income of a population (descriptive) versus testing whether there is a significant difference in income between two groups (inferential).

ANS 10
- Measures of central tendency include the mean, median, and mode. The mean is the average value of a dataset, the median is the middle value when the data is
ordered, and the mode is the most frequently occurring value.
- Measures of variability include the range, variance, and standard deviation. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, the variance
measures the average squared deviation from the mean, and the standard deviation measures the average deviation from the mean in the same units as the data. 
These measures help to understand the spread or dispersion of the data.
