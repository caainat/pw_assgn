Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.
ANS 1
Probability Mass Function (PMF)
What is PMF?
- The PMF is used for discrete random variables (variables that can take on a countable number of values, like rolling a die).
- It tells you the probability of each possible outcome.
Example:
Imagine rolling a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each outcome has an equal chance of happening, so the PMF for each outcome is 1/6.

Probability Density Function (PDF)
What is PDF?
- The PDF is used for continuous random variables (variables that can take on an infinite number of values within a range, like the height of people).
- It describes the likelihood of the variable taking on a specific value, but the probability of any exact value is actually zero. Instead, we look at the probability over an interval.
Example:
Consider a continuous random variable like the weight of apples. If the weights are normally distributed with an average (mean) of 100 grams and a standard deviation of 15 grams, 
the PDF might look like a bell curve centered at 100 grams.

.

 Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?

What is CDF?

The CDF gives the probability that a random variable (either discrete or continuous) will take a value less than or equal to a specific value.
It essentially adds up the probabilities from the beginning up to a certain point.
Example:
Imagine you have a six-sided die. The CDF will tell you the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to a certain value.
Probability of rolling 3 or less: 
𝑃(𝑋≤3)=3\6
​

 Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.

Examples:
1. Heights of people in a population
2. Scores on a standardized test
3. Measurement errors in scientific experiments
4. Daily returns of stock prices

Parameters and Shape:
- Mean : Determines the center of the distribution.
- Standard Deviation : Controls the spread or dispersion. A larger S.D. results in a wider, flatter curve, while a smaller S.D. results in a narrower, taller curve.

 Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.
Importance:
The normal distribution is important because it describes many natural phenomena and measurement errors. It is also the basis for many statistical methods and theorems, such as the Central Limit Theorem.
Real-life Examples:
1. IQ scores in the population
2. Blood pressure measurements in adults
3. Measurement errors in scientific research
4. Average height of a specific species of plants



 Q5: What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?
Bernoulli Distribution:
The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for a random variable that takes the value 1 with probability \( p \) and the value 0 with probability \( 1 - p \).
Example:
A coin flip, where heads (success) is coded as 1 with probability \( p = 0.5 \), and tails (failure) is coded as 0 with probability \( 1 - p = 0.5 \).

Difference between Bernoulli and Binomial Distribution:
- Bernoulli Distribution: Describes the outcome of a single trial (success or failure).
- Binomial Distribution: Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It is the sum of \( n \) independent Bernoulli random variables.

Q6: Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.
ANS
To find the probability that a randomly selected observation from a normally distributed dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 will be greater than 60, we use the Z-score formula and standard normal distribution table.
Steps:
1. Calculate the Z-score:
   The Z-score tells us how many standard deviations a particular value (in this case, 60) is from the mean.
   The formula for the Z-score is:
   Z = X - mean\S.D.
   Plugging in the values:
   Z =( 60 - 50) /10} = 10\10 = 1

2. Find the probability for the Z-score:
   Using the standard normal distribution table, we look up the probability that a Z-score is less than or equal to 1 = approx  0.8413

3. Calculate the probability of being greater than 60:
   Since the total probability is 1, the probability that the observation is greater than 60 is the complement of the probability that it is less than or equal to 60.
   P(X > 60) = 1 - P(Z <=1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587

Conclusion
The probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60 is approximately \( 0.1587 \) or 15.87%.

 
 Q7: Explain Uniform Distribution with an example.

Uniform Distribution:
A uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely. Each interval of the same length has an equal probability.
Example:
The roll of a fair six-sided die has a uniform distribution. 


Q8: What is the z-score? State the importance of the z-score.
Z-score:
A Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean.
Importance:
The Z-score standardizes data, allowing comparison between different datasets. It helps in identifying outliers and understanding the position of a data point within the distribution.

Q9: What is the Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.
Central Limit Theorem (CLT):
The CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean of a large number of independent, identically distributed variables will be approximately 
normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.
Significance:
The CLT allows for the use of normal distribution techniques to make inferences about the population mean, even when the population distribution is not
normal. It underpins many statistical methods and hypothesis tests.



Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.
Assumptions:
The samples must be independent.
The sample size should be sufficiently large (usually 𝑛≥30 is considered sufficient).
The data should come from an identical distribution (i.e., each sample comes from the same distribution with the same mean and variance).
