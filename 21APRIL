Q1: Difference Between Euclidean and Manhattan Distance in KNN
Main Difference:

Euclidean Distance: Measures the shortest straight-line distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space. 
 
Manhattan Distance: Measures the sum of the absolute differences across dimensions (like navigating a grid).
Effect on KNN Performance:

Euclidean Distance emphasizes large differences due to squaring, which can dominate the metric in high-dimensional spaces. It works well when features have similar scales and distributions.
Manhattan Distance is less sensitive to large differences and is better for data with irregular or sparse distributions.
Q2: Choosing the Optimal Value of ùëò
Techniques to Determine Optimal 
k:Cross-Validation:Split the data into training and validation sets. Evaluate performance for different ùëò values and choose the one with the highest accuracy or lowest error.
Elbow Method:Plot the validation error against ùëò The "elbow point" (where the error stops decreasing significantly) is a good choice.
Grid Search:
Use automated tools like GridSearchCV to evaluate a range of ùëò values and find the optimal one.
Domain Knowledge:In some cases, knowledge about the problem domain can guide the choice of k.
Q3: Effect of Distance Metric Choice on Performance
Impact on Performance:

Different distance metrics interpret "closeness" differently, which can lead to different nearest neighbors being selected.
Metrics like Euclidean are sensitive to outliers and feature scaling. Manhattan performs better when the importance of features varies or data is sparse.
When to Choose a Metric:

Euclidean Distance: When the dataset is dense, and all features are equally important.
Manhattan Distance: When the dataset is sparse, contains categorical features, or has varied importance among features.
Minkowski Distance: Generalization that allows switching between Euclidean and Manhattan by tuning the p-parameter.
Q4: Common Hyperparameters in KNN
Number of Neighbors (k):Determines the size of the neighborhood considered. Small k makes the model sensitive to noise, while large k smoothens predictions.
Distance Metric:Choice (Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, etc.) affects neighbor selection and model behavior.
Weights:Uniform weighting treats all neighbors equally, while distance-based weighting gives closer neighbors more importance.
Tuning Hyperparameters:Use grid search or random search for systematic exploration.
Employ cross-validation to evaluate performance.
Normalize data when using distance-sensitive metrics.
Q5: Impact of Training Set Size
Effect on Performance:

Small Training Set: May result in overfitting and poor generalization.
Large Training Set: Improves performance but increases computational cost, as KNN is memory-intensive.
Optimization Techniques:

Sampling: Use techniques like stratified sampling to maintain representativeness while reducing size.
Dimensionality Reduction: Apply PCA or feature selection to reduce feature space, indirectly reducing computational cost.

Q6: Drawbacks of KNN and Solutions
Potential Drawbacks:

Computationally Expensive: KNN has high memory and computation requirements, especially for large datasets.
Solution: Use approximate nearest neighbors (e.g., KD-Trees, Ball Trees).
Sensitivity to Irrelevant Features: Irrelevant or unscaled features distort distance metrics.
Solution: Feature scaling (e.g., Min-Max or StandardScaler) and feature selection.
Imbalance in Data: Performance degrades with imbalanced datasets.
Solution: Use weighted KNN or oversampling techniques like SMOTE.
Curse of Dimensionality: Performance drops in high-dimensional spaces.
Solution: Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).
By addressing these drawbacks, KNN can be more robust and efficient for both classification and regression tasks.
